// an array of pointers to struct? read row into its own struct?

// Goal: create the DS from the csv file to hand to the Cruncher


// The cruncher combines these DSs into one master list, ordered by date
// then goes through and extracts the bank-to-bank transfers that zero out
// then does the calculations on the categories of data
