Look in specified folder for spreadsheets of transactions. For now they are guaranteed transactions only from within a month.
Merge the transactions into one master record.
    Find account transfers across accounts which don't affect the overall balance and cancel them
Use this data to produce a report in different output formats. 
    One which can be saved as a pdf and/or printed for record keeping
    And another which sends data to a web-based dashboard to show the trends and stuff

specify in a yaml file or other config file which directories host which accounts, so that parsers can be matched to files
    For each bank, use an abstract factory to generate the parser for it, throwing an error if such a parser doesn't exist
    When the parser is generated, find each file in that directory and give it to the parser using the ParseFile() method.

Updated records can be seamlessly added, meaning that RecordCruncher will replace old data with new, even when that old data
is already in a final report.

Spreadsheet format should include starting and ending balances. RecordCruncher will use this to verify the totaling, and
check against the previous month's ending-total to ensure no transactions are missed.
